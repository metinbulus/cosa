Description: 
  Implements bound constrained optimal sample size allocation (BCOSSA) framework described in Bulus & Dong (2019) <doi:10.1080/00220973.2019.1636197> for power analysis of multilevel regression discontinuity designs (MRDDs) and multilevel randomized trials (MRTs) with continuous outcomes. Minimum detectable effect size (MDES) and power computations for MRDDs can be conducted with polynomial forms (with or without interaction with the treatment).
